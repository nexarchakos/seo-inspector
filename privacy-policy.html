  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>

  <p>
    SEO Inspector does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. The app performs SEO analysis locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers for processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    SEO Inspector uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve banner advertisements. AdMob may collect data such as your device’s advertising identifier (IDFA), IP address, device type, operating system version, and usage patterns in order to deliver personalized or contextual ads.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are using a version of the app that supports <strong>personalized ads</strong>, you may be asked for permission through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. If you decline tracking, non-personalized ads will still be shown.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party SDKs</h2>
  <p>
    The app includes third-party SDKs such as Google AdMob, which may collect anonymized or device-level data for advertising and analytics purposes. These SDKs are subject to their own privacy policies.
